## 🏋️‍♂️ Example Conversations

**User:** "What's a good workout for building muscle?"

**Chatbot:** "For building muscle, focus on compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, and pull-ups. Aim for 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps per exercise, training each muscle group 2-3 times per week. Don't forget progressive overload - gradually increase weight or reps over time!"

**User:** "How much protein should I eat daily?"

**Chatbot:** "For most active individuals, aim for 0.8-1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (1.6-2.2g per kg). If you weigh 150 lbs, that's about 120-150g of protein daily. Spread it across 3-5 meals for optimal muscle protein synthesis."
